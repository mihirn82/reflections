When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to create a remote repository when you are ready to share the work on your local with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may be working on a new feature in your local repository the changes for which you are yet to add to the remote. Hence, remote may be an older version than the local. By auto-updating the local from the remote you may lose the changes made to local. Hence, it is always better to do manually.

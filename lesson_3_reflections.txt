When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to create a remote repository when you are ready to share the work on your local with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may be working on a new feature in your local repository the changes for which you are yet to add to the remote. Hence, remote may be an older version than the local. By auto-updating the local from the remote you may lose the changes made to local. Hence, it is always better to do manually. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking is used to clone a repository on GitHub for which you do not have permissions to modify.
    Cloning is used to clone a repository locally or to create a clone of your remote on the local
    Branching is used to create a new branch to an existing repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    If you are going to be offline and want all the recent changes on the remote repository locally, it is better to have a copy of the last known state of the remote.
